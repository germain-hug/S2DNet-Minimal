## S2DNet Minimal Loading Code

Minimal code to load S2DNet weights, from the paper [S2DNet : Learning Image Features for Accurate Sparse-to-Dense Matching
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01673)

You can download the pre-trained weights [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hnv51iwu4hn82rj/s2dnet_weights.pth?dl=0)

If you use this code, consider citing:
